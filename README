This Vim plug-in uses the LuaInspect tool to (automatically) perform semantic highlighting of variables in Lua source code. It was inspired by lua2-mode (for Emacs) and the SciTE plug-in included with LuaInspect. For more information about the plug-in please refer to its homepage or the project page on GitHub:
