LuaInspect - LuaInspect is a tool that does Lua code analysis.
It includes an extensive plugin for the SciTE [1] text editor,
there is also a plugin for the VIM editor [2], and it includes
an export to DHTML as well.

== Project Page ==

For further details, see http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaInspect .

== Status ==

WARNING: This code is not yet stable.  It is usable but you
may need to sometimes fix things yourself.  Many additional
features could be added too.

== Features ==

    * analysis:
        * identifies global (red) and local variables (blue), including locals that are
	   function arguments (dark blue) and upvalues (light blue)
        * identifies unused local variables: e.g. `do local x=1 end` (white-on-blue)
        * identifies local variables masking other locals (same name): e.g. `local x=1; local x=2`
	   (strikethrough and squiggle line)
        * identifies local variables that have non-constant binding (`local x = 1; x = 2`) (italic)
        * identifies unknown global variables (white-on-red) and table fields (red), inferred by
	   static and dynamic evaluation.
        * infers values of variables (e.g. `local sum = math.pi + 2` is 5.14.
           and defined-ness of members of imported modules
          (`local mt = require "math"; math.sqrtt(2) -- undefined`)
        * infers signatures of functions (including local, global, and module functions)
        * checks number of function arguments against signatures (SciTE only)
        * cross-references variables (locals and module fields) with their definitions and uses
	  (pink highlight), identifies range of lines/scope where the local is defined
	   (currently SciTE only), and supports jump-to-definition and jump-to-uses (SciTE only)
        * identifies all keywords in selected block (underline)
        * evaluate special comments (prefixed by '!') to inject semantic information into analysis
           (similar to luaanalyze / lint).
        * basic type inferences (e.g. number + number -> number)
	* infer function return values (e.g. `function f(x) if x then return 1,2,3 else return 1,3,'z' end end`
	   returns 1, number, unknown).
	* detect dead-code (e.g. `do return end dead()`) (SciTE only) (diagonal hatching)
    * refactoring:
        * command to rename all occurrences of selected variable (SciTE only)
    * browsing:
        * inspect members of selected table.
        * select statement or comment containing current cursor selection (SciTE only)
        * display real-time annotations of all local variables, like an Excel/Mathcad worksheet
          (experimental feature via ANNOTATE_ALL_LOCALS) (currently SciTE only)
    * auto-complete typing support (SciTE only) (experimental)
    * interfaces: SciTE plugin, VIM plugin, and HTML output.

== Files in this directory ==

metalualib/* - Copy of Metalua libraries under here
luainspectlib/* - LuaInspect libraries under here
htmllib/* - HTML resources under here

Note: the metalualib contains this version of metalua:
  http://github.com/fab13n/metalua/tree/fcee97b8d0091ceb471902ee457dbccaab98234e
with a few bug fixes (search for "PATCHED:LuaInspect" in the source)

== Command-line Usage (HTML output) ==

Example:

  $ lua luainspectlib/luainspect/command.lua  examples.lua > test-output/examples.html

== Installation in SciTE ==

Install SciTE version.  Version 2.12 and 2.20 work (older versions might not work).

First install http://lua-users.org/wiki/SciteExtMan .

Add this to your SciTE Lua startup script (but change LUAINSPECT_PATH):

=============================
local LUAINSPECT_PATH = "c:/luainspect"
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. LUAINSPECT_PATH .. "/metalualib/?.lua"
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. LUAINSPECT_PATH .. "/luainspectlib/?.lua"
require "luainspect.scite" : install()
=============================

Dependencies:
  Tested with SciTE version 2.12 (older versions might not work).  
  Requires http://lua-users.org/wiki/SciteExtMan .
  ctagsdx.lua from the full SciteExtMan is optional (allows "goto mark" command
    to return to previous location following a "go to definition" or "show all variable uses").

If you want to customize styles, add the contents of the
`light_styles` or `dark_styles` variable in the scite.lua file to your
SciTEGlobal.properties, SciTEUser.properties, or SciTE.properties file.

== Configuring SciTE options ==

The following LuaInspect options can be configured in one of your
SciTE property files:

  luainspect.update.always (0 or 1, default 1)
  luainspect.delay.count (integer >= 1, default 5)
  luainspect.annotate.all.locals (0 or 1, default 0)
  luainspect.incremental.compilation (0 or 1, default 1)
  luainspect.performance.tests (0 or 1, default 0)
  luainspect.autocomplete.vars (0 or 1, default 0)
  luainspect.autocomplete.syntax (0 or 1, default 0)
  luainspect.path.append (string, default '')
  luainspect.cpath.append (string, default '')
  style.script_lua.scheme (string, '' or 'dark', default '')

For details, see scite.lua.

== Installation on VIM ==

See [2] for VIM editor support.

== Preliminary support for luaanalyze style comments ==

To make all variables in scope match name 'ast$' be recognized by LuaInspect as a
table with field 'tag' of type string, add this to your code:

  --! context.apply_value('ast$', {tag=''})

The LuaInspect code itself uses this:

  --! require 'luainspect.typecheck' (context)

== Design Notes ==

The font styles are intended to make the more dangerous
or questionable code stand out more.

== LICENSE ==
