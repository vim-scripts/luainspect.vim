LuaInspect - LuaInspect is a tool that does Lua code analysis.
It includes an extensive plugin for the SciTE [1] text editor,
there is also a plugin for the VIM editor [2], and it includes
an export to DHTML as well.

WARNING: This code is not yet stable.  It is usable though
you may need to fix things yourself.  Many additional features
could be added too.

For further details, see http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaInspect .

== Features ==

    * cross-references local variables with their definitions and uses (pink highlight)
    * shows all keywords in selected block (underline)
    * identifies global (red) and local variables (blue)
    * identifies function arguments (dark blue)
    * identifies global variables that are probably undefined (white-on-red)
    * identifies local variables that have non-constant binding (local x = 1; x = 2) (italic)
    * identifies unused variables: e.g. do local x=1 end
    * identifies local variables making other locals (same name): e.g. local x=1; local x=2 (strikethrough)
    * displays signatures of known global functions
    * identifies range of lines/scope where the local is defined (currently SciTE only) 
    * identifies fields and methods as interrogatable variables (e.g. a.b or a:b)
    * infers values of variables (e.g. `local sum = math.pi + 2` is 5.14.
       and defined-ness of members of imported modules:
       `local mt = require "math"; math.sqrtt(2) -- undefined`
    * jump (goto) definition of selected variable (currently locals only in SciTE)
    * list all uses of selected variable (currently locals only in SciTE)
    * select statement or comment containing current cursor selection (SciTE only)
    * command to rename all occurrences of selected variable (SciTE only)
    * inspect members of selected table.
    * display real-time annotations of all local variables, like an Excel/Mathcad worksheet
      (experimental feature via ANNOTATE_ALL_LOCALS) (currently SciTE only)
    * Evaluate special comments (prefixed by '!') to inject semantic information into analysis
       (similar to luaanalyze).
    * Auto-complete typing support (SciTE only) (experimental)
    * checks number of function arguments (SciTE only)

== Files in this directory ==

metalualib/* - Copy of Metalua libraries under here
luainspectlib/* - LuaInspect libraries under here
htmllib/* - HTML resources under here

== Command-line Usage (HTML output) ==

Example:

  $ lua luainspectlib/luainspect/command.lua  examples.lua > test-output/examples.html

== Installation in SciTE ==

Install SciTE version.  Version 2.12 works (older versions might not work).  

First install http://lua-users.org/wiki/SciteExtMan .

Add this to your SciTE Lua startup script (but change LUAINSPECT_PATH):

=============================
local LUAINSPECT_PATH = "c:/luainspect"
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. LUAINSPECT_PATH .. "/metalualib/?.lua"
package.path = package.path .. ";" .. LUAINSPECT_PATH .. "/luainspectlib/?.lua"
require "luainspect.scite" : install()
=============================

Dependencies:
  Tested with SciTE version 2.12 (older versions might not work).  
  Requires http://lua-users.org/wiki/SciteExtMan .
  ctagsdx.lua from the full SciteExtMan is optional (allows "goto mark" command
    to return to previous location following a "go to definition" or "show all variable uses").

If you want to customize styles, add the contents of the
`light_styles` or `dark_styles` variable in the scite.lua file to your
SciTEGlobal.properties, SciTEUser.properties, or SciTE.properties file.

== Configuring SciTE options ==

The following LuaInspect options can be configured in one of your
SciTE property files:

  luainspect.update.always (0 or 1, default 1)
  luainspect.delay.count (integer >= 1, default 5)
  luainspect.annotate.all.locals (0 or 1, default 0)
  luainspect.incremental.compilation (0 or 1, default 1)
  luainspect.performance.tests (0 or 1, default 0)
  luainspect.autocomplete.vars (0 or 1, default 0)
  luainspect.autocomplete.syntax (0 or 1, default 0)
  luainspect.path.append (string, default '')
  luainspect.cpath.append (string, default '')

For details, see scite.lua.

== Installation on VIM ==

See [2] for VIM editor support.

== Preliminary support for luaanalyze style comments ==

To make all variables in scope match name 'ast$' be recognized by LuaInspect as a
table with field 'tag' of type string, add this to your code:

  --! context.apply_value('ast$', {tag=''})

The LuaInspect code itself uses this:

  --! require 'luainspect.typecheck' (context)

== Design Notes ==

The font styles are intended to make the more dangerous
or questionable code stand out more.

== LICENSE ==

See LICENSE file.
